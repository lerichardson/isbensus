# Is ben sus? Let's use an AI neural network, trained by his own tweets to figure out.
A command-line tool that uses a fake AI neural network to tell whether or not Ben is sus.

This is very fake. There is no AI. It's literally just a tool that prints to the console a couple of times.
No harm intended. PRs welcome if you'd like to ensure that Ben is, in fact, sus.  
In hindsight I made this a lot more complicated than it has to be but I don't care because I like doing this kind of thing. Also hello again, Twitter!
